# fewd-treehouse-project7
Unit 7 / Project 7 course work for Front End Developer TechDegree program @Treehouse

Potential fixes:

Align self and center and then add padding???

Or set width to 50% or insert other to dry a certain size 

Need to remove div changing colours when non chart area is hit - likely within the if statement of the event listener
